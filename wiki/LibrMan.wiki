LibrMan (Library Manager) will manage your music library:

  # physically organise your music library into custom directory structure based on the ID3 Information
  # constantly monitor your physical music library for file system changes and accordingly update your ID3 information

Initial release as a standalone utility. Future releases as plugins for popular music players.

== Dependency ==

  * Python 2.6 - http://python.org
  * Mutagen - http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/

== Usage ==

{{{ > librman manage <source> <destination> <parameters> }}}

The _manage_ command helps with creating a new file system organisation of MP3's in a source folder to the specified path inside the the destination folder.

Where:
  * <source> folders with mp3 files to be managed
  * <destination> folder where the library will be managed
  * <parameters> application parameters
    # --nd = No Duplicates, will remove duplicate file names of type x-1.mp3, x_1.mp3, x(1).mp3, where original file is x.mp3
    # --path:%ar|%al|%gr|%lg where %ar = artist, %al = album, %gr = genre, %lg = language. eg: --path:%ar/%al would organise the mp3 files in the path destination/artist/album


{{{ > librman update <lib-path>
